##### Is Scoreo ready to launch? IF NOT, what do we need to do to get it ready to go?
- Not consistent
- We should take some time to plan
- responsive design - mobile
- functionality? We have none!
- Goal for this week: Placeholders for each page
- Logical file structure (organize the site)
- Navbar? Most efficient way to get it on every page?
